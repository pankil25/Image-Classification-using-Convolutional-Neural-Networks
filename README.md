# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture for Image Classification

# Part A:

The architecture can be customized by adjusting parameters such as:

- Number of filters in convolutional layers (num_filters)
- Activation functions (activation)
- Filter organization strategy (filter_organization)
- Batch normalization (batch_normalization)
- Dropout probability (dropout_value)
- Learning rate (lr)
- Number of epochs (num_epochs)
- Number of neurons in fully connected layers (num_nuerons)
- Batch size (batch_size)
- Data augmentation (data_augmentation)

- Pass the path of train dataset folder to :
- Pass the path of test dataset folder to :




# Part B:


The following parameters can be customized:

- Number of filters in convolutional layers (num_filters)
- Activation functions (activation)
- Filter organization strategy (filter_organization)
- Batch normalization (batch_normalization)
- Dropout probability (dropout_value)
- Learning rate (lr)
- Number of epochs (num_epochs)
- Number of neurons in fully connected layers (dense_neurons)
- Batch size (batch_size)
- Freezing option for transfer learning (freeze_option)
- Index of layers to freeze (freeze_index)
- Data augmentation (data_augmentation)


- Pass the path of train dataset folder to :
- Pass the path of test dataset folder to :
